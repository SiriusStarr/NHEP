## Introduction

This document defines the design principles that guide the design and implementation processes of NeoHaskell. They are
intended to guide the decisions in both the high level, as well as the low level, decision making process of the project.

Their purpose is to ensure that the project prioritizes the correct aspects of the design and implementation, and that
[the target audience and user persona](/blog/0002-project-target) are kept in mind at all times, as they are the most
important stakeholders of the project.

## Principle of Least Astonishment

The Principle of Least Astonishment, also known as the Principle of Least Surprise, is a guideline in user interface and software design that emphasizes creating systems which behave in a manner consistent with user expectations, thereby minimizing user surprise and confusion. The principle advises that system components should act in alignment with widely accepted conventions and their syntactical indications. It encourages designers to ensure that the behavior of a system or feature closely matches users' existing knowledge and expectations to reduce the learning curve and prevent user astonishment.

Although the principle originated in the late 1960s, it remains relevant in different technological platforms and settings to ensure that functionalities such as keyboard shortcuts, widgets, or method names are intuitive and adhere to familiar patterns for users, thereby enhancing user experience and system usability.

## Principle of Developer Happiness

The Principle of Developer Happiness prioritizes establishing an environment that aligns with software developers' professional and personal expectations, thereby enhancing satisfaction and retention. It underscores creating engaging experiences and a supportive culture where developers are fairly compensated, and find alignment with the group's mission. Additionally, it advocates for the use of efficient tools and technologies to streamline the development process and save time. Finally, it emphasizes continuous visibility into and assessment of developer efficiency through surveys and feedback, ensuring a continually optimized working environment that resonates with developer needs and expectations. This principle aims to meld operational strategies with developer satisfaction, ensuring an atmosphere that intuitively supports and developers.
